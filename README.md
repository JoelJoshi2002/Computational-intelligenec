# Computational Intelligence - Lab Projects

This repository contains all my lab projects for the **Computational Intelligence** course at the **University of South Bohemia (Jihoƒçesk√° univerzita v ƒåesk√Ωch Budƒõjovic√≠ch)**.

The primary focus of these labs is to build and understand various neural network architectures from the ground up. This repository serves as my personal log of progress and is shared publicly in the hope that it might be a useful resource for peers and anyone new to neural networks and TensorFlow.

## üöÄ Topics & Concepts Covered

These projects are hands-on, code-first explorations of fundamental Computational Intelligence topics, including:

* **Neural Network Fundamentals:** Building simple networks from scratch.
* **TensorFlow & Keras:** Using the TensorFlow 2.x API (both Sequential and Functional) to build, compile, and train models.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Implementing CNNs for image classification tasks (e.g., MNIST, Fashion MNIST).
* **Autoencoders:** Building and training autoencoders for unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for loading, normalizing, and reshaping data (e.g., `to_categorical`, image flattening, and normalization).
* **Model Evaluation:** Analyzing model performance using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

All projects are written in Python and primarily use the following libraries:

* **Python 3.x**
* **TensorFlow 2.x**
* **Keras** (as part of `tf.keras`)
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** (for plotting results and visualizing data)
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** (.ipynb)

## üèÅ Getting Started

You can run these notebooks locally on your machine or directly in Google Colab.

### Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Recommended)

This is the easiest method as all dependencies (like TensorFlow) are pre-installed.

1.  Navigate to a lab folder (e.g., `Lab 3 - CNNs and Autoencoders`).
2.  Click on the `.ipynb` file.
3.  You should see an "Open in Colab" button at the top of the file preview. Click it.
4.  The notebook will open in a new tab, ready to run.

### Option 2: Run Locally

If you prefer to run the labs on your own computer:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git)
    cd YourRepoName
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
s    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib jupyterlab
    ```

4.  **Run Jupyter Lab and open a notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your browser. Navigate to the lab folder you want to view and click on the `.ipynb` file.
